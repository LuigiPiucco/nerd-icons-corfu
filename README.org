Nerd-icons-corfu.el is a library for adding icons to completions in [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu]]. It
uses [[https://github.com/rainstormstudio/nerd-icons.el][nerd-icons.el]] under the hood and, as such, works on both GUI and terminal.
Below if a screenshot of the GUI version.

Note that you need a [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home][Nerd Font]] installed for it to work.

* Usage
~nerd-icons-corfu~ is on [[https://melpa.org/#/nerd-icons-corfu][Melpa]]. You can install it with built-in

To use it, add ~nerd-icons-corfu-formatter~ to ~corfu-margin-formatters~, and
maybe tweak the icons to your linking in ~nerd-icons-corfu-mapping~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'corfu-margin-formatters #'nerd-icons-corfu-formatter)

;; Optionally:
(setq nerd-icons-corfu-mapping
      '((array :style "cod" :icon "symbol_array" :face font-lock-type-face)
        (boolean :style "cod" :icon "symbol_boolean" :face font-lock-builtin-face)
        ;; ...
        (t :style "cod" :icon "code" :face font-lock-warning-face)))
        ;; Remember to add an entry for `t', the library uses that as default.

;; The Custom interface is also supported for tuning the variable above.
